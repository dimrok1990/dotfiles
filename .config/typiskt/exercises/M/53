Dear
Thomas,
Dear
Thomas,
First,
I
consider
of
definite
interest
anything
from
the
business
of
as
good
a
customer
as
you.
As
director
of
our
division,
I
am
to
continue
handling
building
material.
My
judgment
on
all
the
evidence,
which
I
send
herewith
enclosed
in
a
second
envelope,
is
one
of
complete
approval.
Let
me
have
a
contract
covering
the
earliest
delivery
date.
Are
you
advising
me
what
increase
in
your
discount
is
to
be
expected?
Second,
this
forenoon
I
saw
your
son
and
he
told
me
of
his
marriage
in
February.
Although
you
had
not
entirely
finished
the
addition
to
your
lake
house
by
last
December,
couldn't
you
exchange
it,
as
it
is,
for
my
mountain
home?
Your
son
said
that
his
young
wife
wants
to
live
on
this
mountain
to
which
all
your
children
seem
so
attached.
Sincerely
yours,
