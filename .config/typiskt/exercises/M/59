Dear
Alex,
Dear
Alex,
We
are
especially
interested
in
the
settlement
run
by
a
new
department
at
the
University.
We
appreciate
the
importance
of
its
additional
study
to
understand
impossible
conditions
in
the
poor
parts
of
our
city,
and
its
use
for
adjustment
of
some
particular
boy
or
girl.
Have
you
read
our
memorandum
in
this
connection?
Our
city
is
absolutely
too
big.
With
the
automobile
we
can
distribute
every
person
to
his
home
along
a
line,
our
wide
road,
run
far
out
from
the
city.
The
difference
between
country
and
city
grows
less
and
less,
in
accordance
with
such
use
of
the
auto-
mobile.
Concerning
our
collection
of
any
remittance
from
you,
this
would
serve
to
form
a
Conference
which
would
develop
everything
that
can
make
city
governments
bring
full
and
rich
experience
to
all.
Sincerely
yours,
