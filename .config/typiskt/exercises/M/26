In
our
motor
party
on
the
return
trip
an
attractive
quartet
first
tried
to
tell
thirty
or
forty
short
travel
stories.
By
turns
they
transferred
to
the
theater,
to
art
matters,
to
court
trial
stories.
In
the
latter
a
certain
doctor
is
hurt
by
a
first
truck,
another
truck
is
struck,
and
three
contractors
are
thrown
to
the
street.
The
girl's
strong
brother
has
been
hurt.
Further,
there
are
arrests
and
the
sort
of
extra
details
that
enter
into
true
stories.
