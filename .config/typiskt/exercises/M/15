Dear
Hal,
Dear
Hal,
Just
a
line
to
say
I
am
lost
if
I
cannot
fly.
I
have
to
keep
on
here.
I
knew
it
was
but
a
hope
last
May.
It
was
just
my
last
idea
in
June.
Yet
I
held
my
head
high
and
did
not
lose
hope.
Why
not
fly
up
in
the
air
a
half
hour
or
less
and
look
at
my
lake
and
our
home
on
the
hill?
I
left
it
late
last
July
with
one
item
on
my
list.
Bill
gave
me
half
an
hour
of
help.
Like
the
lady
of
the
lake
I
met
the
king.
Bill
was
a
kind
king,
too.
To
lead
off
into
the
air
and
see
all
our
lake
so
long
and
lots
of
land
so
low,
was
to
live
a
high
hour.
I
kept
my
hand
at
my
ear
so
as
to
help
hear.
In
the
air
my
hair
was
a
loss.
It
did
not
kill
me.
I
have
to
fly
to
know
life
can
be
less
hard.
I
like
to
hold
on
and
help
Bill.
I
love
to
fly.
Yours
sincerely,
