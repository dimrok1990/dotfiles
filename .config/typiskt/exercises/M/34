Dear
Alice,
Dear
Alice,
I
shall
start
my
river
story
since
you
have
shown
you
like
my
style.
The
scene
is
a
state
in
the
South.
A
sweet
girl
speaks
of
the
sound
and
sight
of
the
river.
Seven
men
without
shame
raise
the
stock
sales
and
the
boy
tries
to
spend
too
much
at
the
store.
In
order
to
make
a
quiet
and
quick
slide
down
the
river,
the
men
seize
the
boat
while
the
others,
who
are
quite
ready
to
serve
the
girl,
sleep.
It
seems
the
girl
has
sense,
for
on
a
sheet
of
paper
she
writes
that
her
stock
of
gold
is
within
reach
from
a
round
stone
under
the
small
shade
tree.
She
does
not
quote
the
boy,
but
does
refer
to
the
sorry
end
of
his
short
study,
and
in
her
reply
to
his
folks
she
will
state
how
the
gold
may
still
be
spent
in
the
right
way,
which
will
stamp
the
story
as
real.
Yours
sincerely,
