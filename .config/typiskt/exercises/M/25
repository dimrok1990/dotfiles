Dear
"Cab,"
Dear
"Cab,"
Could
you
apply
to
the
court
to
allow
my
claim
as
agent
for
Mr.
Blank?
I
could
bring
in
his
books
and
see
about
his
bills.
If
asked,
he
can
cover
the
costs
by
checks
on
a
bank
that
did
not
break.
Will
you
allow
your
child
to
come
alone
to
see
me?
He
can
have
every
apple
he
can
carry.
By
the
way,
being
clean
and
above
board,
you
must
be
above
bad
cases,
but
you
began
to
bring
in
off-color
cases
after
April.
I
agree
you
do
not
cross
the
law,
but
why
let
men
win
in
a
black
cause
on
any
basis?
Why
not
build
up
your
cases
from
among
men
of
our
own
class?
Close
the
awful
cases
you
now
carry
along
to
court,
and
begin
again.
Sincerely
yours,
