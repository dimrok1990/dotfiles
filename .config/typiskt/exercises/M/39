Dear
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Blank,
Dear
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Blank,
Your
son
has
not
called
on
me.
If
he
is
to
become
almost
an
annual
charge
upon
the
county,
the
church
will
answer
with
action.
Yet,
I
am
afraid
his
arrest
can
not
assure
his
coming
around
and
asking
us
for
advice.
Of
course
he
has
to
appear
before
August.
He
bought
on
credit,
got
behind
in
cash,
and
the
amount
became
too
big.
I
shall
pay
it.
You
are
an
old
couple,
and
I
advise
you
to
accept
this.
Any-
way,
he
is
not
a
common
boy
and
must
have
a
chance.
He
always
does
appear
to
anyone
as
fit.
I
run
across
copies
of
his
art.
I
can
advise
your
son,
attend
to
his
credit,
and
try
to
help
him
arrive
at
a
change
for
the
better.
Sincerely
yours,
