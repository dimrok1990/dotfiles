Dear
Fred,
Dear
Fred,
I
have
dared
to
ask
you
for
an
extra
favor
on
the
first.
If
you
are
not
dated,
I
am
to
draft
you
to
drive
me
by
horse
or
car
up
the
grade
to
the
field
house
at
eight.
I
guess
you
have
not
heard
fully
about
the
great
dance
to
be
given
by
the
girls
on
the
floor
of
the
field
house.
My
hands
have
put
fresh
green
goods
on
the
walls.
Every
girl
has
a
green
dress,
on
its
front
a
funny
glass
heart
that
she
gives
as
a
favor.
The
old
folks
can
drive
up
early,
eat
and
drink
and
enjoy
it
all.
We
will
delay
the
dance
till
the
girls
enter
in
a
dozen
files.
It
would
crush
me
to
death
if
an
error
were
found
in
the
plans.
Happy
hours
on
earth
are
never
heavy.
Can
you
doubt
that
you
are
going?
Sincerely
yours,
