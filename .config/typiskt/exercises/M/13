Dear
Dan,
Dear
Dan,
Yes,
I
came
out
of
the
corn,
back
to
the
city,
both
to
draw
and
to
do
copy
on
the
new
cars.
To
date
I
am
able
to
put
cash
in
the
bank
and
bear
a
bill
or
two.
The
new
deed
has
done
it.
The
city
has
been
busy
but
cold
for
two
days.
Dear
baby
has
been
to
see
her
best
aunt.
A
band
came
by
the
door.
Baby
let
the
bird
cage
drop
down
with
a
blow.
The
bird
died.
Boys
put
its
dead
body
deep
in
a
dark
card
case.
Baby
also
has
a
ball
and
blue
book
to
drop.
I
put
the
boat
away.
Its
deck
did
burn,
but
I
care
not
as
it
does
not
cost
a
cent.
Come,
call
on
me
at
the
club.
Yours
sincerely,
