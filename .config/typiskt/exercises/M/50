Dear
Patrick,
Dear
Patrick,
I
realize
that
this
letter
I
am
sending
may
subject
you
to
some
trouble.
I
am
writing
tonight
without
waiting
to
go
through
various
reports
on
our
present
program.
If
I
had
thought
that
you
would
be
willing
to
give
me
an
extra
day,
perhaps
I
would
have
come
myself.
As
soon
as
this
letter
has
reached
you,
and
you
have
finished
reading
the
several
items
about
which
I
have
written,
I
hope
you
can
give
extra
working
time
to
my
request
for
special
records.
These
items
will
suggest
a
new
plan
as
I
picture
it.
I
shall
add
them
to
this
note.
It
is
my
purpose
to
prepare
a
fast
station-to-station
service
that
should
be
in
running
order
soon.
I
suppose
it
could
be
started
next
month.
Let
me
ask,
also,
whether
we
could
receipt
each
payment,
as
we
receive
it,
on
a
regular
form
similar
to
those
in
the
package
shipped
you
Tuesday.
I
am
pleased
with
your
showing.
You
have
been
like
a
soldier
on
duty
in
any
and
all
weather.
Success
is
your
teacher.
With
my
best
regards,
