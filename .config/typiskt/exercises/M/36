Important
dinner
company
in
our
small
apartment
was
not
common,
and
November
ninth
mamma
was
solemn
in
manner.
The
moment
nine
American
gentlemen
were
announced,
fun
and
argument
began.
I
remember
one
ancient
gentleman,
manager
of
much
more
income
than
mine,
who
was
not
solemn
as
imag-
ined,
but
funny
and
human,
even
if
normal
demand,
planned
movements
of
modern
machines
to
Canada,
long
term
payments,
and
columns
of
numbers
meant
much
more
to
him
than
to
me.
