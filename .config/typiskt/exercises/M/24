Dear
Tris,
Dear
Tris,
It
is
so
very
warm
at
this
time
of
year,
I
told
my
wife
that
you
and
I
wish
to
go
west
for
a
week
or
two.
Did
I
tell
you
what
a
wind
we
had?
I
went
to
town
to
vote
for
the
one
man
whom
I
want.
I
took
a
well-used
tire.
When
it
went
down
on
a
bad
turn,
in
the
woods,
I
had
to
walk.
Then
the
wind
more
than
set
in,
and
I
had
to
wait
by
a
wall.
It
got
our
old
tree.
I
saw
two
men
and
set
them
to
work
on
the
car,
till
they
told
me
it
was
no
use.
If
I
were
to
turn
it
in,
is
it
true
that
you
can
take
your
car?
I
want
a
wide
view
and
I
want
to
talk
with
you.
Thus
I
wait
upon
your
word.
Wire
yes
if
you
will
take
this
trip.
Yours
sincerely,
