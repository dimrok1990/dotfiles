How
I
acquired
a
bequest
from
a
quizzical
Quaker.
How
to
apply
it
was
a
quandary.
As
a
quasi
artist,
I
began
in
Albuquerque
to
make
a
quantity
of
plaques
of
chance
Indian
acquaintances.
My
masquerade
as
an
artist
of
quality
in
that
quaint
land
of
quite
Spanish
art
and
adobe
was
adequate
and
equally
unique.
Squeezed
in
quiet,
antiquated
adobe
quarters,
I
began
quickly
and
without
qualms
to
qualify
as
an
artist.
After
quarrels
and
questions
over
my
queer
tech-
niques,
I
acquired
my
quota
of
opaque
plaques.
