Dear
Mrs.
White,
Dear
Mrs.
White,
I
have
been
holding
on,
but
this
January
I
am
getting
out.
My
wife
herself
may
have
told
you
of
our
opening.
However,
I
go
at
ten
o'clock
this
morning,
and
your
husband
is
still
out.
He
is
to
do
my
general
work
himself,
and
may
not
imagine
there
is
any
measure
of
justice
in
that.
We
married
men
are
obliged
to
do
as
ordered.
I
am
leaving
a
hundred
matters.
He
has
my
opinion
on
each.
Tell
him
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
of
the
members
are
on
my
table.
Tell
him
I
haven't
an
invoice,
but
have
instead
an
October
bill,
for
our
new
machine
parts.
He
may
mention
this
item
to
the
manager,
as
he
has
neither
its
history
nor
my
letters
of
inquiry.
I
find
nothing
else
to
include.
We
shall
miss
you
greatly,
and
we
shall
be
looking
for
you
at
our
new
home.
Yours
sincerely,
