Students
should
be
assisted
in
studying
seated
at
their
desks;
cross-questioned
as
to
their
needs
and
desires;
ad-
vised
to
use
up-to-date
leads
based
on
studies
of
standards.
By-products
of
student
days,
well-bred
friends,
kindness,
self-help,
with
good
grades
and
degrees,
are
listed
as
far-
sighted
aids.

old-fashioned

co-

said
sadly
that
ideas
are
missed
less
than
first-
class
friends
and
good-natured
wishers.
