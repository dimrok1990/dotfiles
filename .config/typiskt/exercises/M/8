It
is
the
effort
against
odds
that
thrills.
We
feel
these
drives
that
never
let
down.
We
feel
(this

way
Rice
put
it)
the
champion
forces
himself
into

Can

A
typist
has
to
face
such
days
of
"mental
torture"
too.
Some
days
he
has
to
force
himself
along.
He
need
not
punish
his
machine.
He
must
pull
himself
together
(100%)
to
type
his
steady,
smooth
way
over
all
upsets.
