The
JOURNAL
learned
that
the
relatives
on
their
arrival
in
April
had
already
referred
the
trouble
to
lawyers.
Their
early
re-
turn
surprises
me.
As
to
the
children
themselves,
the
older
girls
are
personally
agreeable,
slender,
and
certainly
full
of
zest.
They
travel
yearly
and
already
are
familiar
with
the
world.
Their
father
was
a
quizzical
old
man
who
fairly
idolized
them.
His
will
leaves
them
very
nearly
a
half-million
dollars.
Only
the
earlier,
first
will
is
very
irregular.
I've
already
quizzed
them
about
the
real
hazards
of
quarrels
over
legal
prizes
of
similar
size.
From
their
replies
I've
realized
slowly
that
the
girls
are
all
right.
It
really
amazes
me
that
even
persons
like
ourselves
promptly
seize
upon
some
hostile
relative's
version
of
an
earlier
will,
which
should
be
recognized
easily
as
false.
