Dear
Mrs.
White,
Dear
Mrs.
White,
I
wish
to
thank
you
for
the
words
you
wrote
three
weeks
ago,
and
I
trust
you
will
write
again
on
the
wrong
and
waste
of
war.
As
I
watch
the
wheels
of
events
today,
I
think
you
value
a
thing
it
has
taken
me
a
third
of
my
years
to
see.
In
its
total
trade
the
world
is
one
whole,
and
each
part
in
touch
with
the
other
at
most
times.
The
usual
farm
woman
won't
see
a
trade
table
or
understand
its
terms,
for
she
is
tired
with
her
efforts
to
train
and
teach
her
young.
She
has
tried
to
throw
her
value
into
her
home,
which
to
her
is
worth
so
much.
War
can
not
be
put
under
until
these
women
see
there
is
but
one
world,
which
truly
is
their
world.
Where
will
you
be
while
the
thick
wheat
is
harvested?
If
not
across
the
water,
would
you
visit
us,
using
your
voice
to
teach
us
these
things?
Yours
sincerely,
