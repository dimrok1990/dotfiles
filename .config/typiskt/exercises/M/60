Dear
Sir,
Dear
Sir,
I
wish
to
acknowledge
the
recent
interesting
correspondence
from
your
office
on
the
very
considerable
requirements
of
the
new
law
that
have
to
do
with
any
unfortunate
advertising
that
might
appear
in
my
papers.
Our
association
also
has
appreciated
both
your
instructions
and
the
opportunity
for
prompt
examination
and
understanding
of
the
new
arrangement,
particularly
its
application
to
all
informa-
tion
given
the
public
about
merchandise
for
sale.
This
has
been
a
real
convenience
in
our
consideration
of
the
entire
proposition.
I
want
to
assure
you
that
our
co-operation
under
the
new
law
will
be
satisfactory
in
every
way.
Yours
respectfully,
