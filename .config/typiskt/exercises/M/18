Dear
"Pie,"
Dear
"Pie,"
I
open
most
of
my
mail
and
meet
the
news.
I
note
that
you
say
Mrs.
Page
is
a
mere
name
but
you
met
the
Miss
Page.
You
must
need
the
car.
Once
the
pass
is
open
I
can
move
the
car
over
to
you.
Do
you
mind
if
I
make
it
part
of
a
nice
plan
to
meet
Miss
Page,
too?
Mrs.
Page
was
only
a
mile
past
us.
Her
son
was
my
age
and
I
made
the
mile
at
noon
to
play
a
bit.
She
paid
us
for
milk.
She
did
not
mean
much
to
me,
but
her
son
did.
Next
we
had
more
fun
up
the
pass
near
the
poor
old
No.
Nine
mine.
I
can
mark
many
a
mile
we
once
ran.
I
must
mail
this
note
or
I
may
miss
the
post.
Yours
sincerely,
