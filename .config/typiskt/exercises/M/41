I
quit
the
quiz
when
I
saw
the
quantity
of
queer
hazy
questions.
To
seize
lesser
prizes
required
answers
to
a
dozen
queries.
Only
a
quarter
of
the
quotas
qualified
with
zest.
Many
had
zero
when
the
quiz
asked:
In
what
zones
are
Brazil,
Switzerland,
Arizona,
or
Texas?
Zebras
in
our
zoos
grow
to
what
sizes?
Analyze
and
quote
one
great
citizen's
query
as
to
zeppelins.
Criticize
the
quality
of
jazz
music.
