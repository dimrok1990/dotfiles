Dear
Bea,
Dear
Bea,
I
am
glad
you
feel
so
for
the
farm
in
the
East.
Even
as
a
girl
of
four
or
five
I
was
ever
so
glad
to
find
the
farm.
In
my
eyes
it
was
all
as
good
as
gold.
Even
my
feet
felt
good.
A
girl
can
gain
and
grow
fast
on
farm
food
and
the
fine
free
air.
Why
else
did
face
and
form
grow
full
and
fair
so
fast?
On
each
foot
of
my
farm
I
felt
free
from
fear.
It
gave
me
my
fill
of
fun.
I
felt
no
fear
of
any
fire
in
the
fall.
Now
the
fire
is
a
fact
and
my
farm
is
gone.
Give
me
my
full
life,
etc.
The
game
goes
on.
Yours
sincerely,
