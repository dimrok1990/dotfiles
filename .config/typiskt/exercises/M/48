Dear
Annabel,
Dear
Annabel,
My
brother
and
his
college
friends
in
the
factory
decided
to
arrange
an
evening
exactly
as
in
the
old
days.
After
calling
us,
they
arrived
and
we
carried
out
the
idea.
We
used
an
old
college
catalog
and
each
girl
had
an
old
college
dress.
Further
to
advance
the
evening,
my
brother
advised
us
of
an
old
address
near
the
freight
yard
where
certain
college
boys
brought
this
or
that
article
and
were
allowed
a
few
dollars.
As
we
went
in,
an
old
man
came
a
step
farther,
fell
forward
and
against
me.
Brother
charged
him.
Will
you
believe
this
care-
ful
account
I
enclose?
Between
brother
and
me
lay
this
old
man
who
did
seem
dead.
I
can't
express
my
feeling.
His
head
was
covered
with
marks
of
blows.
Already
we
were
anxious
to
go.
Yet
his
safe
was
open,
as
if
to
furnish
us
the
old
books
with
the
many
expense
charges
against
the
college
boys.
When
I
looked
to
see
who
of
our
company
were
in
them,
I
read
one
balance
after
another
paid
from
the
old
country
to
My
Dearest
Son.
You
are
correct
if
you
guess
we
now
ran,
because
we
did.
What
follows?
Today's
paper
doesn't
have
a
line.
Yours
sincerely,
