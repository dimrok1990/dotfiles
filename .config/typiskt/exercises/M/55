Dear
Son,
Dear
Son,
I
am
beginning
this
afternoon
to
give
my
immediate
attention
to
a
Christmas
that
should
be
beautiful.
I
have
addressed,
to
be
forwarded
and
delivered
in
good
condition,
some
new
equipment
according
to
your
wish.
I
note,
too,
that
your
committee
met.
What
these
gentlemen
said
is
important
and
may
be
a
sort
of
in-
surance
that
your
plan
does
not
fail.
I
certainly
would
not
want
to
duplicate
for
you
the
kind
of
education
given
me.
Be
different
by
following
more
than
one
new
idea,
including
some
of
your
own.
If
you
can
carefully
take
fair
advantage
of
every
available
condition,
everybody
should
accept
you
cordially,
as
answering
to
the
character
of
a
gentleman.
Mother
is
enclosing
a
few
lines.
Yours
sincerely,
