Dear
Dick
Dear
Dick
I
have
a
dollar.
I
expect
you
to
follow
me
and
take
dinner.
Friday
I
didn't
have
cash,
but
a
friend
of
the
family
had
enough
for
both
of
us.
Father
is
having
all
the
lot,
except
the
garden,
filled
in
during
the
week.
Giving
in
to
his
desire,
I
intend
to
work
the
ground.
Doctor
says
that
my
health
is
hardly
an
excuse,
so
I
had
better
decide
to
make
an
effort.
Indeed,
I
am
driven
either
to
finish
the
work
in
the
near
future
or
pay
to
have
it
done.
I
am
hoping
you
will
happen
upon
some
kindly
fellow
to
whom
a
flower
garden
itself
is
fun,
and
inform
me.
I
shall
direct
him,
as
the
entire
effect
will
lie
in
the
way
we
handle
the
ground
plan.
Don't
forget.
Yours
sincerely,
