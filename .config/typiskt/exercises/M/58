Dear
Gertrude,
Dear
Gertrude,
This
letter
has
no
reference
to
shipments
which
you
have
so
kindly
purchased
from
me
in
the
past.
Rather,
as
you
are
returning
to
this
territory
by
September,
our
president
has
re-
quested
me
as
secretary
to
ask
that
you
make
a
statement
before
our
club
the
first
Wednesday.
Let
me
say
something
of
the
questions
we
have
been
receiving
for
the
year.
Recently
I
read
that
the
old
principle
today
still
applies.
It
is
wonderful
what
our
new
knowledge
has
surprised
us
into
regarding
as
necessary
for
ourselves--sometimes
things
not
even
mentioned
yesterday.
Will
you
therefore
represent
this
new
deal
and
present
the
situation
to
us
in
principle,
sincerely,
as
you
see
it?
Other-
wise,
if
you
cannot
make
this
provision
now,
I
shall
be
glad
to
call
upon
you
later.
Yours
sincerely,
