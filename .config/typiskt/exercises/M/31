If
truly
quoted,
you
and
Guy,
mere
youths,
fly
a
con-
tinuous
journey
of
thousands
of
miles
yearly
in
your
study
of
numerous
flying
routes.
You
say
you
were
south
in
July
in
the
dry
country
conspicuous
for
yucca,
but
now
you
are
busy
buying
a
quota
of
various
useful
items
to
supply
your
outfit
for
the
famous
Yukon.
Yet
I
am
suspicious
when
you
say
this
unusual
survey
is
monotonous
rather
than
glorious.
You
should
hurry
surely
to
Vancouver
for
some
delicious
yuletide
fare.
It
seems
only
yesterday
that
I
was
conscious
of
being
young
and
vigorous
enough
to
fly
my
buoyant
plane.
If
you
lucky
boys
are
victorious
over
any
unusually
furious,
dangerous,
or
anxious
double
duty
on
this
survey,
write
a
quotable
account
yourself
for
the
Journal.
