Dear
Rollin,
Dear
Rollin,
I
did
notice
a
number
of
the
pretty
places
I
passed
in
the
air
nearly
two
months
ago,
and
I
can
at
length
locate
the
best.
If
prices
remain
rather
low,
I
will
not
return
for
any
person
or
be
prompt
at
orders.
I
can
play
a
record
or
two,
and
not
regret
there
is
no
report
to
be
looked
at.
I
want
to
be
myself
and
regard
nature,
not
people.
To
obtain
this
latter
result
is
the
proper
reason
for
making
this
quiet
trip.
So
far
from
the
public,
matter
in
the
papers
will
be
old
and
market
policy
of
little
moment.
It
will
please
me
to
have
you
with
us
longer
than
the
others.
I
was
really
living
for
the
period
when
I
would
be
placed
with
you
both.
Your
mother
has
a
lovely
manner.
I
am
glad
to
oblige
so
recent
a
member
of
our
office,
too.
This
letter
is
being
mailed
Monday,
and
in
two
days
we
shall
go.
Yours
sincerely,
