Dear
Madam,
Dear
Madam,
I
have
your
two
later
notes
of
March
1.
Maybe
it
is
a
large
order
for
you
to
leave
for
the
north
in
the
month
of
March.
Our
place
is
miles
away,
but
the
real
issue
is
that
mu-
sic
means
much
to
us.
A
night
of
music,
even
one
piece
of
music,
has
often
meant
more
to
me
than
my
local
paper
and
all
the
power
I
have
known.
If
I
can
plant
a
love
of
music
in
all
parts
of
this
place
so
that
all
who
hear
you
sing
can
learn
to
love
it,
it
will
mean
more
to
me
than
money.
I
never
laugh
at
money,
but
isn't
it
plain
in
these
lines
that
price
ought
to
be
the
least
of
all
the
items?
The
point
is
that
our
plans
for
your
party
are
more
important.
If
you
read
our
other
offer
in
the
light
of
our
love
for
music,
we
might
not
seem
so
far
away.
Yours
sincerely,
