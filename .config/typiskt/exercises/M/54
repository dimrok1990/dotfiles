Dear
Nathan,
Dear
Nathan,
My
last
shipment
has
probably
been
received,
for
the
purchase
was
made
Thursday.
Tomorrow
is
Saturday,
a
pleasant
day,
for
I
go
on
my
vacation.
Do
you
remember
an
original
idea
you
proposed
last
November
relative
to
planning
for
some
shipping
from
my
property?
My
neighbor
recently
called
it
a
plan
in
a
thousand,
and
we
must
get
together
so
that
I
can
thank
you
properly.
This
is
a
national
as
well
as
personal
question,
and
I
am
trusting
that
you
will
be
thinking
that
it
is
possible
for
you
to
help
put
it
into
practice.
If
you
can
possibly
separate
yourself
from
teachers
and
your
teaching
position
sometime
soon,
plan
to
get
a
standard
car
and
whatever
else
is
required
for
the
trip.
The
car
would
also
be
a
pleasure
after
you
return
to
New
York.
May
I
persuade
you
in
re-
plying
to
state
that
you
are
planning
to
come
promptly?
We
will
make
you
one
of
the
officers
of
the
shipping
business.
Yours
sincerely,
