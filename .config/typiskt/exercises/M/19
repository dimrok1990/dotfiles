Dear
Ross,
Dear
Ross,
It
is
a
real
rain.
The
road
is
so
soft
my
car
can
but
roll,
stop,
and
roll
on.
Are
you
on
the
ship?
If
I
get
as
far
as
the
ship,
can
we
sail
in
such
a
rain?
If
we
try
to
sail,
the
ship
is
sure
to
rock
or
ride
on
one
side.
If
I
get
sick,
it
is
up
to
you
to
stay
by
and
show
us
how
to
save
the
ship.
Ann
has
some
sort
of
song
to
sing
in
the
rain.
She
said
she
sent
it
to
you.
Did
you
read
of
our
sale?
We
set
out
a
big
sign.
Now
any
sort
of
suit
and
any
size
seem
to
sell.
We
are
not
rich
but
we
can
soon
step
out
or
be
sold
out,
if
any
such
rate
is
to
rule.
Ann
has
not
seen
the
ship
as
yet.
Rain
or
no
rain,
Ann
says
to
send
her
out.
All
the
rest
of
us
say
the
same.
Can
you
ring
me
in
my
room
at
the
shop?
Yours
sincerely,
