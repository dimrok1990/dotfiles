Dr.
Ted
feels
the
first
fruit
is
too
green
for
young
or
old.
After
one
eats
any
of
it
he
is
sorry.
In
fact,
if
I
try
it,
that
night
in
fancy
I
sail
the
South
Seas
for
eight
hours.
The
air
is
fine
and
clear;
on
the
ship
are
only
fruit
and
I.
To
a
lady
in
those
seas
I
gladly
offer
all
fruit
and
candy.
There
is
no
reply.
Only
the
seas
run
high
and
I
feel
ill.
