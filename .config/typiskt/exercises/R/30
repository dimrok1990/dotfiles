To
tell
this
class
all
there
is
to
learn
is
not
a
real
help
later.
Let
the
class
plan
the
loose
ease
that
can
hold
each
hand
in
place,
or
plan
to
end
this
or
that
poor
slip,
or
plan
to
do
its
total
lines
in
less
hours.
As
a
rule,
to
plan
and
to
do
are
also
to
learn.
The
class
plans
to
drop
the
old
action
to
clear
the
road.
Those
old
slips
are
lost.
The
class
has
large
plans;
gains
in
hours
and
less
slips.
