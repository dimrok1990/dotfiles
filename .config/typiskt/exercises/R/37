Dear
Ted,
Dear
Ted,
After
I
read
your
dandy
note
I
felt
sorry
for
the
lady.
Here
is
plenty
of
cash
if
you
young
people
agree
to
spend
it
sanely.
Is
it
for
a
natty
sail
or
only
for
golf?
Did
you
and
Dan
play
or
fight?
Dan
said
he
felt
as
if
a
full
load
of
coal
hit
his
head.
Is
that
fact
or
fancy?
Yours
sincerely,
