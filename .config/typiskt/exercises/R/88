Satisfy
yourself
that
it
will
be
funny,
but
perfectly
satisfactory,
for
forty
or
fifty
of
the
faculty
to
fly
from
Buffalo
to
New
York
on
the
first
Friday
in
February.
If
they
prefer,
we
will
offer
them
waffles,
jelly,
and
coffee
before
they
fly
or
get
dizzy.
Sixty
flyers
can
qualify
confidently
to
face
any
difficulty.
A
friendly
inquiry
from
any
family
will
be
very
cheerfully
and
fully
answered.
