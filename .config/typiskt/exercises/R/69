In
our
queen
city
I
used
to
value
two
covers
set
every
day.
At
these
I
used
to
serve
a
young
man
and
a
girl.
I
did
love
to
see
her
quiet
dress
and
quick
smile
favor
her
so.
I
have
never
quite
seen
her
equal,
or
a
girl
so
very
alive.
After
I
had
given
over
this
work,
I
went
there
to
see
them.
One
night
I
saw
a
query
form
on
her
lips
until
she
gave
it
up
and
took
leave.
The
way
she
quit
the
boy
was
very
queer
even
if
the
papers
did
quote
his
prison
term
as
five
years.
