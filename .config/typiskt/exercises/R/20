Dad
and
his
son
are
to
start
on
a
trip
in
our
red
car.
House
cares
are
the
sort
that
upset
Dad
and
he
is
so
tired
that
he
tries
a
nap
in
order
to
rest.
It
rains
at
a
great
rate.
Dan
is
too
sure.
He
has
heard
this
road
is
poor
in
parts.
It
is
a
great
error,
Dan,
to
rush
a
short
turn
on
a
grade.
The
car
turns
out
and
ends
on
its
side.
Hurt?
No.
