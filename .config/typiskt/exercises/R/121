How
much
do
you
weigh?
A
young
boy
who
is
5
feet
tall
may
weigh
112
pounds;
with
an
extra
inch,
115
pounds.
Add
3
pounds
for
any
inch
added.
Thus
if
5
feet
and
4
inches,
he
may
weigh
124.
If
taller,
add
4
pounds
for
each
added
inch.
If
5
feet
and
7
inches,
he
may
weigh
136;
if
5
feet
and
9
inches,
144;
if
5
feet
and
10
inches,
he
may
weigh
148.
Now
add
5
pounds
for
each
added
inch.
Thus
to
stand
6
feet
tall
may
mean
158
pounds.
It
is
better
to
be
a
little
over-weight.
