Get
the
gang.
Catch
this
sign.
Get
going.
Go
up
this
high
Get
the
gang.
Catch
this
sign.
Get
going.
Go
up
this
high
post
and
put
a
sign
on
top.
Put
these
copies
on
each
post.
I
guess
no
one
intends
to
stop
us.
The
cast
is
set.
Each
scene
is
set.
Each
act
can
open
in
good
shape.
I
hope
that
enough
cash
is
paid
in
so
the
cast
need
not
stand
the
costs.
