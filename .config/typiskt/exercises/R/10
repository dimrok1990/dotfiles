The
High
dance
opens
at

and
the
gang
is

So
Ted
shuts
the
piano
and
stops
at
the
phone
to
catch
Ann.
I
ought
to
post
Ted
that
he
pounds
the
piano
as
I
once
did.
I
guess
he
is
upset.
He
has
to
catch
Dad
to
get
the
cash.
He
has
to
see
Ann
to
each
dance.
This
is
not
a
noisy
night.
His
auto
is
a
cheap
one
and
no
good
on
a
night
such
as
this.
