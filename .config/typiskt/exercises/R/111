throw
a
carriage
do
you
take
6
or
7
times--or
to
shift
for
a
capital,
2
or
3
times--as
long
as
to
hit
one
letter?
And
do
you
know
the

keys?
One
common
pair
of
letters
is
used
for
every
3
or
4
other
pairs,
even
though
there
are
more
than
600
other
pairs.
The
digits
are
0,
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,

You
will
spell
these
out
more
often
than
you
will
type
them.
