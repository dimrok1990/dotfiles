By
using
the
new
banks
of
keys
on
the
new
keyboard,
you
are
able
to
learn
or
excel
with
less
labor.
These
new
banks
have
been
based
on
an
exact
table
of
words
used.
You
begin
at
once
on
the
best
bank.
On
the
old
keyboard
you
have
to
type
most
of
the
text
on
the
next
bank
above
and
on
the
bank
below.
Because
of
this
fact
your
fingers
bound
back
and
forth
between
the
upper
and
lower
banks
of
keys.
But
those
extra
jumps
necessary
on
the
old
keyboard
do
not
exist
on
the
new
keyboard.
Nor
is
your
left
hand
taxed
with
extra
labor.
The
keys
are
fixed
to
keep
both
hands
busy
and
in
balance.
