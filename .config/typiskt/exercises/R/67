The
queen
put
this
query
in
a
quick
voice
to
quell
them
all:
Why
does
the
whole
world
love
a
lover?
Why
do
we
value
you?
All
did
laugh.
The
queen
asked
that,
as
a
favor,
you
give
us
those
who
have
nerve,
for
they
can
love
and
serve.
Quite
as
one
who
gave
an
equal
favor,
the
queen
sang
over
the
radio.
