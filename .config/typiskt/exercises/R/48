Dear
Tom,
Dear
Tom,
Mr.
May
has
one
new
car.
It
has
a
low
red
top.
The
top
is
so
low
you
can
not
see
the
sun
if
you
sit
in
the
car.
Mr.
May
has
not
let
his
own
son
use
it.
I
saw
his
son
try
to
put
the
top
up.
I
ran
and
met
him.
Why
not
be
men
and
run
the
car
out?
We
did.
We
set
out
to
run
it
at
six.
We
two
ran
it
off
to
an
old
lot
by
the
sea.
Did
his
pa
see
us?
Yes,
sir,
who
but
Pa
was
at
No.
Ten
as
we
ran
by
in
the
car--and
Ma,
too.
Oh,
it
was
war--his
pa
had
a
lot
to
say.
Let
me
lay
out
the
law
to
you.
You
may
not
use
the
car
as
you
did
not
pay
for
it.
You
are
not
yet
a
man.
Son
did
not
lie
nor
did
he
win
his
way.
How
are
you
all?
Now
if
you
get
a
new
car,
let
me
run
it.
Yours
sincerely,
