A
dozen
small-sized
craft
frozen
in
the
ice
are
afire
under
a
cold
azure
sky.
It's
near
zero
in
the
fire
zone;
and
over
the
ships
now
razed
to
the
water's
edge,
a
light
haze
hangs.
I'm
dazed
as
I
gaze
at
my
own
ship;
I'd
never
recognize
that
crazy
maze
of
still
fizzing
ruins
as
a
deck.
What
a
fizzle!
