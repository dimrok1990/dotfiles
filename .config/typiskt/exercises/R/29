Dear
Ted,
Dear
Ted,
A
day
ago
Ann
got
a
bad
cut
on
her
arm
and
a
few
by
her
eye
and
ear.
It
is
an
act
of
God
she
did
not
die.
Her
car
did
the
job.
It
is
the
end
of
her
car.
She
has
no
use
for
a
car.
The
fee
is
to
be
big.
She
is
in
bed,
but
she
can
not
eat.
She
can
not
eat
a
bit
of
egg.
It
is
no
fun
at
all.
It
is
hot.
It
is
too
hot
for
her
fur
hat,
but
I
can
buy
a
box
for
it.
I
am
due
any
day.
I
can
cut
a
day
if
I
fly.
It
is
not
far
if
I
go
by
air.
If
I
go
by
car,
I
add
a
day.
How
is
Dan?
Did
he
get
his
job?
Dan
had
to
beg
for
it
if
he
did.
He
is
big
and
fat
but
not
bad.
The
boy
can
do
it
if
he
can
act
to
fit
his
age.
Ask
him
not
to
act
as
a
kid.
Yours
sincerely,
