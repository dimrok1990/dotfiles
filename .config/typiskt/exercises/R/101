Bound
for
some
place
where
the
sun
sets
in
the
west,
soon
it
is
the
night
that
I
favor.
Next
to
the
night
and
boat
and
water,
maybe
I
judge
our
sail
by
its
excellent
bill
of
fare.
Here
I
am
very
exact,
as
I
never
set
a
poor
table.
I
stock
an
up-to-date
table,
set
out
under
the
first
dozen
stars.
I
enjoy
having
every
boy
able
to
quaff
his
quota
of
soup
and
boast
or
sing
with
zeal
and
make
any
queer
joke.
With
a
moon,
I
can
name
no
event
to
equal
a
boat
and
water.
