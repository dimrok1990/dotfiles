panes
Sadness
possesses
her
as
she
stands
against
the
panes
that
the
sash
separates.
She
is
sad
because
the
same
dress
is
not
washed
and
in
shape;
and
so
she
says
it
is
useless
to
save
it.
She
is
sad
also
because
she
has
to
stay
in
Alabama
next
season.
She
says
to
plan
to
sail
across
the
seas
to
Alaska
or
Asia
or
Spain
is
useless.
So
in
June
she
amuses
herself
by
drawing
five
or
six
quaint,
small-sized
maps.
