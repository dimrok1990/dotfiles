To
attain
a
personal
association
with
so
popular
an
author
is
an
approved
social
ambition.
To
loan
him
money
or
catalog
his
books

consider
a
favor.
Today
his
tailor,
later
with
a
coat,
loads
on
him
a
thousand
pardons.
A
normal
Mon-
day
program
allows
a
lazy
forenoon
to
ocean
and
boat;
after-
noon
to
various
auto
roads
in
orange
season;
night
to
play
contract
or
follow
the
local
opera.

for
another
book,
our
author
is
anxious
to
go
abroad.
