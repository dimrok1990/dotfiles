A
note
from
Ann
says
her
friend
prefers
to
change
her
return
to
Arizona
from
next
February
to
November.
The
reason
is
an
error
of
the
owner
of
the
ranch
who
will
not
refund
her
rent.
The
janitor
is
running
some
errand,
for
he
has
worked
in
the
rain
near
the
northern
entrance
during
dinner.
I
hear
that
now
neither
her
friends
from
North
Carolina
nor
Virginia
can
remain
an
afternoon
and
refrain
from
a
quarrel.
