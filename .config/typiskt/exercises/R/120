Eleven
invitations
for
Thanksgiving
vacation
arrived
in
advance
of
November.
In
vain
have
a
dozen
relatives
invited
me
to
visit
Vermont,
Virginia,
and
Nevada.
I
love
being
invited
and
I
believe
in
never
avoiding
an
invitation
to
any
Thanksgiving
banquet.
I
even
plan
to
have
the
sixth
to
the
seventeenth
of
November
for
varied
ventures
and
to
visit
that
novel
Denver
University
on
my
vacation.
