I'll

I'll
admit
I
seize
a
chance
to
go
with
these
dozen
people.
We
left
under
an
azure
sky,
yet
today
it's
rainy
and
hazy.
That
Dr.
Tedd
is
odd;
he
won't
play;
he's
doing
a
report
on
how
to
zone
cities
of
any
size;
so
he
won't
let
us
dance
to
radio
jazz.
Tonight
we're
to
try
a
play
that
hasn't
any
zest
or
zip.
Its
prize
is
Tom's
money,
and
he'll
not
stay;
he
feels
it's
a
fizzle.
My
zeal
for
gazing
on
the
crowd
is
at
zero.
They
don't
and
can't
pass
any
play
quiz.
