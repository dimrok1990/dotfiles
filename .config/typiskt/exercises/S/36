He
hath
brought
many
captives
home
to
Rome.
Whose
ransoms
did
the
general
coffers
fill:
Did
this
in
Caesar
seem
ambitious?
When
that
the
poor
have
cried,
Caesar
hath
wept:
Ambition
should
be
made
of
sterner
stuff:
Yet
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious;
And
Brutus
is
an
honourable
man.
You
all
did
see
that
on
the
Lupercal
I
thrice
presented
him
a
kingly
crown,
Which
he
did
thrice
refuse:
was
this
ambition?
Yet
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious;
And,
sure,
he
is
an
honourable
man.
