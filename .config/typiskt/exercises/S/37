I
speak
not
to
disprove
what
Brutus
spoke,
I
speak
not
to
disprove
what
Brutus
spoke,
But
here
I
am
to
speak
what
I
do
know.
You
all
did
love
him
once,--not
without
cause:
What
cause
withholds
you,
then,
to
mourn
for
him?
O
judgement,
thou
art
fled
to
brutish
beasts,
And
men
have
lost
their
reason!--Bear
with
me;
My
heart
is
in
the
coffin
there
with
Caesar,
And
I
must
pause
till
it
come
back
to
me.
