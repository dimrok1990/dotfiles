When
I
awaked
it
was
just
daylight.
I
attempted
to
rise,
but
I
found
my
arms
and
legs
were
strongly
fastened
on
each
side
to
the
ground;
and
my
hair,
which
was
long
and
thick,
tied
to
the
ground
in
the
same
manner.
I
likewise
felt
several
slender
ligatures
across
my
body,
from
my
armpits
to
my
thighs.
I
could
only
look
upward;
the
sun
began
to
grow
hot,
and
the
light
offended
my
eyes.
I
heard
a
confused
noise
about
me;
but
in
the
posture
I
lay
could
see
nothing
except
the
sky.
In
a
little
time
I
felt
something
alive
moving
on
my
left
leg,
which,
advancing
gently
forward
over
my
breast,
came
almost
up
to
my
chin;
when
bending
my
eyes
downward
as
much
as
I
could,
I
perceived
it
to
be
a
human
creature
not
six
inches
high,
with
a
bow
and
arrow
in
his
hands,
and
a
quiver
at
his
back.
In
the
mean
time
I
felt
at
least
forty
more
of
the
same
kind
(as
I
conjectured)
following
the
first.
