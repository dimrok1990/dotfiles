Now,
it
is
a
fact,
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
par-
ticular
about
the
knocker
on
the
door,
except
that
it
was
very
large.
It
is
also
a
fact,
that
Scrooge
had
seen
it,
night
and
morning,
during
his
whole
residence
in
that
place;
also
that
Scrooge
has
as
little
of
what
is
called
fancy
about
him
as
any
man
in
the
city
of
London,
even
including--which
is
a
bold
word--the
corporation,
aldermen,
and
livery.
Let
it
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
Scrooge
had
not
bestowed
one
thought
on
Marley,
since
his
last
mention
of
his
seven
year's
dead
partner
that
afternoon.
And
then
let
any
man
explain
to
me,
if
he
can,
how
it
happened
that
Scrooge,
having
his
key
in
the
lock
of
the
door,
saw
in
the
knocker,
without
its
undergoing
any
inter-
mediate
process
of
change--not
a
knocker,
but
Mar-
ley's
face.
