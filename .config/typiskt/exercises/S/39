But

But
mercy
is
above
this
scepter'd
sway,--
It
is
enthroned
in
the
heart
of
kings,
It
is
an
attribute
to
God
himself;
And
earthly
power
doth
then
show
likest
God's
When
mercy
seasons
justice.
Therefore,
Jew,
Though
justice
be
thy
plea
consider
this--
That
in
the
course
of
justice
none
of
us
Should
see
salvation:
we
do
pray
for
mercy;
And
that
same
prayer
doth
teach
us
all
to
render
The
deeds
of
mercy.
I
have
spoke
thus
much
To
mitigate
the
justice
of
thy
plea;
Which
if
thou
follow,
this
strict
court
of
Venice
Must
needs
give
sentence
'gainst
the
merchant
there.
