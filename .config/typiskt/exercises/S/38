The

is
not
strain'd;
The
quality
of
mercy
is
not
strain'd;
It
droppeth
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
Upon
the
place
beneath:
it
is
twice
bless'd;
It
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes:
'Tis
mightiest
in
the
mightiest;
it
becomes
The
throned
monarch
better
than
his
crown;
His
sceptre
shows
the
force
of
temporal
power,
The
attribute
to
awe
and
majesty,
Wherein
doth
sit
the
dread
and
fear
of
kings;
