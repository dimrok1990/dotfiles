Dear
Sirs:
Dear
Sirs:
I
have
just
purchased
a
Heathkit
H89
computer
system
and
would
like
to
order
two
boxes
of
diskettes
for
it.
This
system
uses
5
1/4
inch,
hard-sectored,
ten-sector,
single-sided,
single-
density
diskettes.
Enclosed
is
my
check
for
$45.00.
Please
rush
this
order,
as
I
can
not
use
my
system
before
they
arrive.
Sincerely,
Mr.
Smith
