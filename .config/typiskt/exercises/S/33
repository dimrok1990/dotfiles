But,
soft!
what
light
through
yonder
window
breaks?
But,
soft!
what
light
through
yonder
window
breaks?
It
is
the
east,
and
Juliet
is
the
sun!--
Arise,
fair
sun,
and
kill
the
envious
moon,
Who
is
already
sick
and
pale
with
grief,
That
thou
her
maid
art
far
more
fair
than
she:
Be
not
her
maid,
since
she
is
envious;
Her
vestal
livery
is
but
sick
and
green,
And
none
but
fools
do
wear
it;
cast
it
off.--
It
is
my
lady;
O,
it
is
my
love!
O,
that
she
knew
she
were!--
She
speaks,
yet
she
says
nothing:
what
of
that?
Her
eye
discourses,
I
will
answer
it.--
I
am
too
bold,
'tis
not
to
me
she
speaks:
