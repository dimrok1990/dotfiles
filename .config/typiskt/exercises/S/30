I
lost
no
time,
of
course,
in
telling
my
mother
all
that
I
knew,
and
perhaps
should
have
told
her
long
before,
and
we
saw
ourselves
at
once
in
a
difficult
and
dangerous
position.
Some
of
the
man's
money--if
he
had
any--was
certainly
due
to
us;
but
it
was
not
likely
that
our
captain's
shipmates,
above
all
the
two
specimens
seen
by
me,
Black
Dog
and
the
blind
beggar,
would
be
inclined
to
give
up
their
booty
in
payment
of
the
dead
man's
debts.
The
captain's
order
to
mount
at
once
and
ride
for
Dr.
Livesey
would
have
left
my
mother
alone
and
unprotected,
which
was
not
to
be
thought
of.
Indeed,
it
seemed
impossible
for
either
of
us
to
remain
much
longer
in
the
house:
the
fall
of
coals
in
the
kitchen
grate,
the
very
ticking
of
the
clock,
filled
us
with
alarms.
