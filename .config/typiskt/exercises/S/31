The

by
The
neighborhood,
to
our
ears,
seemed
haunted
by
approaching
footsteps;
and
what
between
the
dead
body
of
the
captain
on
the
parlor
floor,
and
the
thought
of
that
detestable
blind
beggar
hovering
near
at
hand,
and
ready
to
return,
there
were
moments
when,
as
the
saying
goes,
I
jumped
in
my
skin
for
terror.
Something
must
speedily
be
resolved
upon;
and
it
occurred
to
us
at
last
to
go
forth
together
and
seek
help
in
the
neighbor-
ing
hamlet.
No
sooner
said
than
done.
Bareheaded
as
we
were,
we
ran
out
at
once
in
the
gathering
evening
and
the
frosty
fog.
