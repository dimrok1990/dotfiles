Strive
for
typing
accuracy.
Speed
without
accuracy
is
of
little
value.

Rhythm
is
the
secret
of
typing
skill.
Don't
write
one
part
of
a
word
faster
than
another.
Slow
down
so
that
you
can
maintain
a
regular
rhythm.
Think
of
the
letters
before
you
strike
them.
Strike
the
keys
evenly,
so
that
the
printing
impression
does
not
vary.
At
the
same
time,
try
to
develop
your
stroking
speed
and
make
it
a
habit
to
release
the
keys
quickly.
To
get
up
speed,
type
each
exercise
three
or
four
times.
To
do
your
best,
it
is
necessary
that
you
be
relaxed.
You
may
be
trying
so
hard
that
you
are
all
tied
up
in
knots.
Relax
consciously.
If
you
have
a
feeling
of
tenseness
and
hurry,
you
are
not
properly
relaxed.
