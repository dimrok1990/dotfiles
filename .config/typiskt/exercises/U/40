To
learn
to
typewrite
is
not
difficult.
The
keyboard
of
the
typewriter
may
be
mastered
in
a
few
hours,
but
to
get
speed
in
typewriting
calls
for
a
good
deal
of
practice.
One
of
the
best
methods
of
getting
up
speed
is
to
write
a
selection
over
and
over
again
until
it
can
be
written
easily
and
accurately.
