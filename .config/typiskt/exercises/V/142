Your
typewriter
is
equipped
with
a
bell
which
rings
to
warn
you
that
you
are
approaching
the
end
of
the
line.
On
some
machines,
the
bell
rings
five
spaces
before
the
margin
stop
is
reached;
on
other
machines,
it
rings
when
there
are
six
or
seven
spaces
left.
The
ring
of
the
bell
permits
you
to
keep
your
eyes
on
the
copy.
When
you
hear
the
bell,
finish
the
word
you
are
typing
and
throw
the
carriage
for
the
next
line.
Do
not
look
up
to
watch
for
the
end
of
the
line;
you
may
lose
your
place
in
the
copy.
Always
keep
your
eyes
on
the
copy
like
the
expert
typist.
