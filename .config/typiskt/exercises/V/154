The
backspace
key
is
one
of
the
most
useful
time-
saving
devices
on
your
typewriter.
You
use
it
to
back
up
a
space,
to
darken
a
light
impression,
or
to
pivot.
To
pivot
means
to
type
a
line
so
that
the
last
letter
is
at
the
right
margin
or
other
chosen
point.
For
example,
if
you
want
a
date
line
to
end
at
the
right
margin,
place
the
carriage
with
the
printing
point
indicator
at
the
right
margin
and
backspace
once
for
each
stroke
in
the
date
line.
The
most
important
use
of
the
backspace
key
is
in
centering
words
or
lines.
