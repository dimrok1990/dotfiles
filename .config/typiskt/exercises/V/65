Never
put
off
until
tomorrow
any
job
you
should
finish
today.
Try
to
be
prompt
at
all
times.
No
one
likes
to
be
kept
waiting.
Keep
on
working
just
as
diligently
as
you
have
been
doing
up
to
this
point.
You
will
soon
be
a
master
of
the
keyboard.
You
will
have
a
valuable
skill
that
will
repay
you
for
your
efforts.
Remember
this:
every
boy
and
girl
is
able
to
learn
typing.
All
they
have
to
do
is
to
put
forth
their
very
best
efforts.
This
means
thinking
while
training
every
finger
to
strike
the
right
key.
