have
seen
in

the
hyphen
is
used
for
typing
compound
words.

are
a
few
more
examples:
up-to-date,
first-class,
by-product.
The
hyphen
is
used
also
to
divide
words
between
syllables
at
the
end
of
a
line.
When
the
bell
rings,
finish
the
word
if
it
is
short--less
than
six
letters.
If
the
word
is
longer,
divide
it
at
the
end
of
a
syllable.
The

following
words
show

be
divided
at
the
end
of
a
line:
after-noon,
state-ment,
hesi-tate,
cer-ti-fi-
cate,
exami-na-tion.
