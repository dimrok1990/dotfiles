Zip
codes
are
arranged
so
that
the
first
3
digits
designate
the
regional
office
and
the
last
2
digits
designate
the
local
branch.
The
numbering
is
roughly
east
to
west.
That
is,
numbers
starting
with
0
are
in
New
England,
numbers
starting
with
1
are
the
New
York
area,
etc.
There
are
notable
exceptions
to
this
rule,
however.
The
Virgin
Islands
are
south
of
Florida,
but
their
Zip
Codes
start
with
00.
