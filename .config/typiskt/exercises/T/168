The
new
nine
digit
zip
codes
have
upset
quite
a
few
people.
It
was
bad
enough
being
referred
to
as
73218.
But
now,
we
will
have
to
remember
numbers
like
73218-4208.
The
worst
hit
will
be
the
companies
whose
mailing
list
programs
were
poorly
designed.
Those
unstructured
programs
will
be
very
difficult
to
change.
